            <h1 class="row">A Loading Screen For Nothing</h1>
            <p class="row"> 
                So, for my first blogpost, I created a terribly slow loading JavaScript
                animation. I really don't like how long it leaves the user waiting for the index.html
                page to load, and even when it does load, retrieving the fonts I wanted left for an unsightly
                font replacement. To hide all this ugliness, for this week I learned some more basic CSS animations
                using keyframes. But these animations would be used as a loading screen as the main page takes its time
                to render.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of the modernization for my client's website, for project 1, I believe will come from elegant
                yet simplistic graphic animations to make the page pop. I intend to use some more complicated JavaScript, home-brewed,
                animations with a mix of general hover transform animations, which will end with at least a few seconds of loading time.
                The design for the loading screen comes from the six teams at Camp Kids Place. The oldest-camper teams Red and Yellow,
                for boys and girls respectively, then Blue and Orange, and lastly Green and Purple, would be represented by stacked circles
                in the center of the page rotating at different speeds. For the sake of this blogpost, in which my learning is based on
                <a href="https://www.superhi.com/video/how-to-add-a-simple-loading-screen-to-your-site">this</a> article, I will
                show the code for make a single circle rotate in the center of the screen. Here we have the most basic HTML to represent 
                elements we'll need on the page.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                &lt;div class="loading"&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="images/LoadOut.svg"&gt;<br>
                &lt;/div&gt;<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we need to ofcourse fill the entire page with a fixed color on the highest z-index to hide any elements that may lie
                below. We'll also use flexbox ordering to move the circle into the middle of the page.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                .loading {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;position: fixed;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;top: 0;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;left: 0;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;width: 100%<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;height: 100%;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #0d98ba;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;z-index: 2;<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;justify-content: center;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: center;<br>
                }<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Next it's time to create a keyframe we call rotate to specify what we want. In this case we want the circle to complete a
                full rotation, so we use the 0% and 100% indicators to determine the starting position in the animation and the end goal.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                @keyframes rotate <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;0% {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tranform: rotate(0deg);<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;100% {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tranform: rotate(360deg);<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The last bit of CSS we'll need is to call the keyframe rotate animation we just created on the image found inside our
                loading &lt;div&gt;.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                .loading > img {<br>
                   animation: rotate 2s infinite linear;
                }<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Perfect! Now he have an infinitely rotating circle, and no real website to interact with. At this point, I would need
                to create a JavaScript file to handle the "termination" of the loading screen. All we'd need is query select the loading
                div element and add a class to it which changes it's opacity to zero, as well as adds the pointer-event none to it so that
                the mouse will be able to interact with items on the page that are at a lower z-index.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for making it this far! Now it's time I add actual content to the website.
