                Okay, say  I were to teach CS 347 next fall I believe I would follow similar structure in content, and the order of that content, that we had this semester.
                The biggest difference I would make would be instead of writing pure HTML pages from the start, I would have the students as quickly as possible generate these html pages within
                JavaScript. My reasoning for this is that the structure and elements of HTMl are so simplistic and self explanatory that by adding the buffer of using JavaScript to
                generate these HTML pages, as well as using new elements and features for the first time, would not impede on the learning experience of HTMl. All the while, additional
                JavaScript knowledge and practices can be taught alongside HTML lessons. The process would be similar to the end of the semester content of working in React, giving
                the students time to start thinking about scripting and page content generation.

                When it comes to CSS, I really benefitted from copycat labs. In my mind there isn't a better method of teaching the individual CSS components and styling except by recreating
                existing page layouts and design. So I would start students off for the first 3 CSS labs doing progressively harder and more complex designs, however, to not choke
                creativity and allow the students to enjoy the options CSS offers, the last labs involving CSS would be vague but still have requirements. That way students can showcase
                their designs at the end of class and see how they thought differently from one another. Also flexercise is a great tool for the early CSS teaching.

                Tackling React is likely one of the more important goals of this course as any student that would like to continue pursuing web development would likely end up using web
                frameworks in the future and thus it is important to become familiar with at least one. I know I struggled early on with React personally because I felt that the syntax of
                JavaScript (ignoring JSX) changed slightly when React was installed because I was not yet confident in my familiarity with JavaScript syntax. I also understand that this
                is a higher level computer science class meaning we should be more attuned to learning a language on our own, however my earlier change of making sure students are completely
                familiar with base JavaScript when working through HTMl content will better prepare them to start working with frameworks, in this case React. I think that we should teach the
                use differences between classes and hooks in React as well such that when looking online for guides/information they can translate code examples which use classes.
