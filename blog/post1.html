        <h1 class="row">Canvas Elements and Animation</h1>
        <p class="row"> Let me begin by stating I was way in over my head on this one. As much as I enjoy the 
          general creative freedoms that come with web developement, I probably shouldn't have tried to anything
          so demanding in format and technical drawing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This week I learned how to make use of canvas elements to draw different forms, as well as how to animate
          the drawing of said forms. My goal was to recreate my own version of the following
          <a href="https://codepen.io/loktar00/full/uEJKl">aesthetic scrolling background scene.</a><br>
          I started attempting my own mountain terrain through the random selection of heights across a determined number of peak points
          spanning the distance of the screen width. It looked a little something like this:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          const width = canvas.width;<br>
          const height = canvas.height;<br>
          const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');<br>
          ctx.fillStyle = 'black';<br>
          <br>
          function plotPoints(points) {
            const pts = generatePoints(32);<br>
            // first plot the stroke<br>
            pts.forEach((pt) => ctx.lineTo(pt.x, pt.y));<br>
            ctx.stroke();<br>
            // now define the bottom of the filled area<br>
            const maxY = height; //Math.max.apply(null, pts.map(pt=>pt.y));<br>
            // draw the missing parts<br>
            ctx.lineTo(pts[pts.length - 1].x, maxY); // bottom-right<br>
            ctx.lineTo(pts[0].x, maxY); // bottom-left<br>

            ctx.globalCompositeOperation = "destination-over"; // draw behind<br>
            ctx.fill(); // will close the path for us<br>
            ctx.globalCompositeOperation = "source-over"; // normal behavior<br>

          }<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          My initial idea was after drawing each range with its own generated array of points which were plotted to their individual
          canvases, I would then be able to call shift() on their array of plots and append a new mountain point at the end of the array to
          simulate the scrolling of terrain. At the time I was also attempting to use several setInterval() functions as a means of animating my
          mountains, in a sense like:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          // apply different intervals for each plot to give sense of depth<br>
          setInterval(plotPoints(mountain1Points) {<br>
          }, 1000);<br>
          setInterval(plotPoints(mountain2Points) {<br>
          }, 2000);<br>
          setInterval(plotPoints(mountain2Points) {<br>
          }, 3300);<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          This proved to be hazardous to the performance of the tab, and my computer at that, so I ended up scrapping all that code. This was also
          the time I transitioned to using the requestionanimationframe() function that has been adopted by most modern webbrowsers. Anyways, one thing
          lead to another and I ended up attempting to do a vertical wave animation of changing oppacity. I used the Date js object to measure milliseconds
          to offset when I would start changing the opacity of one of the several canvases I divided my window with. You can experience the level of success I had
          with this on my index.html page. I definetly learned more from my mistakes on this assignment, however it has given me enough familiarity with the basic to intermediate
          uses of canvases, especially with javascript utilization, to improve on what I have so far. That and the number of stackoverflow and w3schools pages I've had to read over.
          I can also attribute most of my learning to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2au9EfeRQ">little canvas animation youtube tutorial.</a>
