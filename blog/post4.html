                You really can't have a website for a summer camp without plenty of media showing the kids actually
                enjoying it. That's why this week I pursued creating an infinitely scrolling horizontal banner for the
                Camp Kids Place home page, in which I was trying to dispaly as much camp activity as possible at first glance. This blog
                post is sponsored by the one <a href="https://designshack.net/articles/css/infinitephotobanner/">article</a>
                which gave me a straight forward approach to creating said banner, however through the use of hardcoding the combined width
                of all the images in the banner.
                With the help of countless tabs of stackoverflow and w3schools I created a simple enough algorithm
                to make the infinity banner work with any number of images (website performance be damned).
            </p>
            <p>
                To explain the general concept behind the infinity banner: You have a row of images, and then you append the exact same row of images
                to the end of said row. In other words, each image appears twice, however not sequentially, and each image is equally spaced from its copy.
                The reason for this is that the animation to pull this off is a simple xTranslation. You want the last image, before the copied row, to exit
                the screen left while maintaing the illusion that the images wrapped back around the the right side of the screen. This mean the translation
                distance should only be half of the total distance of the combined identical rows of images. So, when the last image of the original row
                goes off screen, the identical row is in the exact starting place of the original. Then, the animation loops from 100% to 0%, in which case the
                original row immediately swaps places with it's copy cat and proceeds to move left again.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my banner has two stacked rows of images, the following JavaScript code shows how to make a custom keyframe based on the number of images in a banner
                consisting of one row. This is assuming you have one div tag populated by img tags. So first, we need to request the div containing the banner
                images by its id, declare a variable to hold the calculated banner width, and then loop through half of the div's img children to only get the sum
                without any duplicate images.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                var images = document.getElementById('banner').childNodes;<br>
                var bannerLength = 0;<br>
                for(let i=0; i &lt; (images.length/2); i++) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;if (images[i].nodeName.toLowerCase() == 'img') {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bannerLengthTop -= (images[i].clientWidth);<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we need to create a style element in which we will be adding a keyframe to. So we'll need a var to hold the string for that as well. And then replace
                the placeholder term with the calculated width.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                var style = document.createElement('style');<br>
                <br>
                var keyFrame = '\<br>
                @keyframe infinityBanner {\<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;0% {\<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform: translateX(0);\<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;}\<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;100% {\<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform: translateX(TRANSLATE_DISTANCE);\<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;}\<br>
                }\'';<br>
                <br>
                keyFrame = keyFrame.replace(/TRANSLATE_DISTANCE/g, bannerLength + "px");<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, we inject html into the style element we made, and then append it to the head of the document. In the style sheet you'll have to call the keyframe we made
                on the banner id. 
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                style.innerHTML = keyFrame;<br>
                document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(style);<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that that's done, maybe I can actually get around to adding content to the website.
