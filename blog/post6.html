                I'll be honest here, I'm still pretty new to all this React stuff, and apparently we've already started using the
                {useState} Hook with our React lectures and labs. Reading up on the <a href=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">introduction of hooks</a>
                in the React 16.8 update, apparantley Hooks were a fix for an unconnected web of problems in React that mostly stem from the component model.
                React alone did not offer an easy way to reuse stateful logic between components, however Hooks allow the extraction of stateful logic from a
                component for independent testing and reuse, but more importantly reusing said logic without changing the component hierarchy you've created. Also,
                it's easy for the complexity of components to abound, even when they start simple, yet Hooks let you divide a component into smaller functinos based
                on related pieces. Lastly, Hooks allow the use of more of React's features without the use of classes, which have been described as a sizeable barrier
                to learning React. While all of this is great, I still didn't quite understand what a Hook was in the grand scheme of things until the overview on the 
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">next page</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hooks are, "functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components." So not only do they let you use React without
                classes but understandably they aren't useable inside classes at all. React provides the useState, which is called inside a function component to add some
                local state to it. One example of this was when we implemented it for our palette in Lecture 16. There's also the useEffect Hook, adding the ability to perform side
                effects from a function component. Both of these provided Hooks can be used more than one in a single component.
            </p>
            <p>
                Used in tangent, an example could be a number which increments every time a button is clicked handled by the useState, and the effect of that would be the
                document title being updated to say how many times the button's been clicked using the useEffect Hook.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                function Example() {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;const [count, setCount] = useState(0);<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;useEffect(() => {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;});<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;return ... // the html div for the page<br>
                }<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                You are also able to write your own custom Hooks, which are not only reusable throughout an application in which they're defined, but also throughout all of your
                applications. Here I'll show you an exmple of custom Hook called useInputValue, which makes handing inputs in your components a lot more concise.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                import {useState} from "react";<br>
                <br>
                export const useInputValue = initialValue => {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onChange: e => {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setValue(e.target.value || e.target.innerText);<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;};<br>
                };<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                React really isnt even used here because no JSX is being returned/rendered. Still, the useInput function simply takes an initial value, sets it from
                the value variable from useState, and then returns an object containing the value and an onChange function. Something to keep in mind is that to use this
                custom Hook would mean making sure to use an event listener in React for the updater function.
            </p>
            <p>Finishing this blog post with honesty, there's still a lot I'm confused about here, but I image project 2 will help ingraining React concepts through practice.</p>
